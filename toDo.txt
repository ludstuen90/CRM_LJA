Add Error validation to "add note feature"
Make so case note loads automatically



case ID doesnâ€™t update when saving

FRONT PAGE WORK:
Now, only open cases will load. Update the drop-down with cases so that it also begins as "OPEN"
Then, you'll need to add so that when you change dropdown selection, and press 'reload' (and add button),
only cases of THAT TYPE will load. For example, 'canceled', or 'closed'.
